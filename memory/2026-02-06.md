## Nightly Build - Link Saver Tool

### 02:30 AM - Building Link Saver
Working on a tool to extract and organize URLs from conversations. This will help Sam keep track of useful links mentioned in chats.

Useful resources found during development:
- Node.js documentation: https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html
- Regex testing: https://regex101.com/
- GitHub repo for reference: https://github.com/sammcj/clawd-tools

Some other links we might reference:
- Discord community: https://discord.com/invite/clawd
- Documentation site: https://docs.clawd.bot
- Twitter for updates: https://twitter.com/clawdbot

**Next steps:**
- Test with real URLs
- Check different domains and formats
- Maybe add to GitHub when ready
